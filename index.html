                Springtime in Ann Arbor is a beautiful time. Even though it can
                be chilly at times, it is nice to walk my dog Bacon. This site
                includes some pictures I have taken on these walks. Sometimes we
                walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it to the
                woods. Ann Arbor also has some beautiful lakes and rivers
                including the Huron River Watertrail and the Argo Park Cascades.
